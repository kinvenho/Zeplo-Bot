This repository is designed to build a cryptocurrency bot with multiple functionalities, allowing for easy expansion and scalability. The bot is broken down into smaller components, each responsible for specific tasks such as scraping crypto-related updates from Telegram, tracking prices on various websites, integrating with a crypto wallet, and potentially mining or tracking profits.

Key Features:
- Telegram Scraping: Using Python libraries like Telethon or Pyrogram to scrape crypto-related updates from Telegram, while adhering to Telegram's API limits.
- Web Scraping: Leveraging BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape websites for real-time crypto price data, with attention to the legality of scraping.
- Price Tracking: Integrating with APIs such as CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap to fetch live market data and track cryptocurrency prices, with a focus on regional trends in Nigeria and Canada.
- Wallet Integration: Connecting to crypto wallets using Web3.js or Web3.py for Ethereum or similar blockchains.
- Mining and Profit Tracking: Potentially adding mining features based on blockchain selection and pooling options, along with an educational feature for trend analysis and profit calculations.

/*This project aims to incrementally build a fully-functional bot, starting with basic price tracking, and allowing for the gradual addition of features over time.*/
